The goal of mlrmodel is to fit a multiple linear regression using matrix calculations. It contains a virtual dataset with y and x, which are created by random variables. Using this model, we can estimate the coefficients of variables, partial SSE, se(beta_hat), t value, p value, significance of each variables, R square. Meanwhile, this function also contains a Rcpp function, which can calculate the mean of each x variables.

Compare with the traditional lm() function, the lrm() function can remains the same effect. Meanwhile, the Rcpp file can also have the same effect with the original R function.


## Installation

You can install the development version of mypackage and vignettes from github with devtools:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("htzheng1018/625hw3", build_vignettes = T)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(mlrmodel)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
```{r}
n = 50
x1 = rnorm(n)
x2 = rnorm(n)
x3 = rnorm(n)
x = cbind(x1, x2, x3)
y = 4 + 3 * x1 + 2 * x2 - 1.5 * x3 + rnorm(n)
```

call our function
```{r}
lrm(y, x)
```

Compare with the original function lm().
```{r}
lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3)
```

use Rcpp to calculate mean
```{r}
lrm(y, x, Rcpp = T)
```

Compare with the original function.
```{r}
colMeans(x)
```

We use benchmarks to test the efficiency of our new function.
```{r}
library(bench)
effct_func <- bench::mark(myfunc = {
  beta_my <- as.vector(round(as.numeric(lrm(y, x)$smry[, "beta"]), 3))
}, lmfunc = {
   beta_lm <- as.vector(round(summary(lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3))$coefficients[, "Estimate"], 3))
})
summary(effct_func)
```

We use benchmarks to test the efficiency of our Rcpp.
```{r}
effct_func_new <- bench::mark(rcppfunc = {
  mean_my <- as.vector(round(as.numeric(lrm(y, x, Rcpp = T)), 3))
}, orginfunc = {
   mean_og <- as.vector(round(colMeans(x), 3))
})
summary(effct_func_new)
```
